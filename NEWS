CHANGES in BioGeoBEARS VERSION 1.1.3

NEW FEATURES

    o removed kexpmv from Suggests (this package no longer available on CRAN)
    o various accumulated bug fixes (see GitHub commits)

OTHER CHANGES

    o none


CHANGES in BioGeoBEARS VERSION 1.1

NEW FEATURES

    o added all code and features from PhyloWiki page
    o put the PhyloWiki test scripts in as unit tests, with the testthat package

OTHER CHANGES

    o none


CHANGES in BioGeoBEARS VERSION 0.23

NEW FEATURES
    o TODO: Cairo package for graphics; constraining multiple nodes; stochastic mapping

	o added error check to read_PHYLIP_data() -- (checking for rows with less than the 
	  specified number of characters/areas
	
	o edited example script so that 3-parameter "+J" models start with the ML results of the 
	  2-parameter model. This should avoid situations where the LnL found during ML search of 
	  the 3-parameter model is lower than the ML returned by the 2-parameter model.
	
    o added extract_params_from_BioGeoBEARS_results_object(), a function to extract free
      parameter values, rather than using the plot_BioGeoBEARS_results() function to do
      this.

    o changed function name to be more accurate: get_perEvent_probs --> get_clado_perEvent_weights
    
    o fixed: optimx, optim usage and graphing

    o fixed: re-sizing titles

    o minor changes to graphing functions
    
    o better summary plot to screen for section_the_tree (and better double-checking / 
      error check of this)
      
    o tiplikes_wDetectionModel returns scaled raw likelihoods if desired

    o tiplikes_wDetectionModel returns likelihoods normalized by the maximum (i.e., some 
      state gives likelihood=1 to the data, or LnL=0). This may help prevent underflow 
      issues for large datasets

    o tiplikes_wDetectionModel error check now internalized
    
    o tiplikes_wDetectionModel Now an option in both unstratified and stratified analyses

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed minor bugs in stratification, due to not excluding is_fossil==FALSE, and to 
      calc_loglike_sp wrongly renormalizing tip input likelihoods passed from the 
      stratification functions
    o edited CITATION information

OTHER CHANGES

    o  issues: print_optim, warning for very small trees, check maxent01v parameterization (divide by mean)
    o  check dispersal file, areas allowed file for correct number of areas
    


CHANGES in BioGeoBEARS VERSION 0.21

NEW FEATURES

    o added detection probability models
    o added calculations of prior probabilities of ranges, conditional likelihoods of 
      detection/taphonomic control counts conditional on ranges, and posterior probabilities
      of ranges, given their priors and data likelihoods
    o added more plotting options, e.g. pie charts on corners
    o added rounding to plot of cladogenesis model
    o added CITATION file and information

BUG FIXES

    o Fixed minor bugs in the plot_BioGeoBEARS_model function.

OTHER CHANGES

    o none
    


CHANGES in BioGeoBEARS VERSION 0.2

NEW FEATURES

    o Added new functions for displaying ancestral range estimates, a legend for same, 
      and a graphical depiction of the initial or inferred model parameters & speciation
      model.
    o Added new function features for incorporating fossil tips in the likelihood 
      calculations in the correct way, stratifying the tree correctly so that the same
      likelihoods are produced in stratified and un-stratified analyses under the same 
      model.  Several utility functions to aid with steps of this.
    o Added an error check function to catch many of the common sources of problems, e.g.
      mismatches between the tip names in the input Newick and geography data files.
    o Added importFrom() commands to the NAMESPACE for the several packages where only 
      one or a few functions were needed.

BUG FIXES

    o fixed minor bug in tree sectioning/chainsaw2 function, which was due to not all
      concatenated labels being strsplit on commas, then sorted, then concatenated again,
      before being compared.

OTHER CHANGES

    o removed LaplacesDemon dependency, as that package is now maintained off CRAN. 
      Bayesian functions using LP have been moved to an example script.
    





CHANGES in BioGeoBEARS VERSION 0.1.2

NEW FEATURES

    o more examples

BUG FIXES

    o using normalizePath() to make examples work in Windows (fixing compile error
      noted by Uwe of CRAN)

OTHER CHANGES

    o none
